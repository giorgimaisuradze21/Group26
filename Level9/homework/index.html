<!--Python information-->
    <h3>;Python is a <i> programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis</i>. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isnt specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today.
        According to a study by Statista, Python is the third most commonly used programming language among developers worldwide [1].</h3>

<!--Javascript information-->

    <h4>The first r <strong>popular web browsea graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993</strong>. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.</h4>

<!--Java information-->
    <p>was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. <u> was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sus Java platform</u> The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, <em> had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license</em>. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.</p>

<!--Assembly information-->
 </body>

<p> <b>he first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work, Coding for A.R.C..</b>[8] Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. The term "assembler" is generally attributed to Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill in their 1951 book The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer,[9] who, however, used the term to mean "a program that assembles another program consisting of several sections into a single program".[10] The conversion process is referred to as assembly, as in assembling the source code. The computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called assembly time</p>

<!--Fortran information-->
<p>Fortran has evolved through numerous versions and dialects. In 1966, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) <strong>developed a standard for Fortran because new compilers would slightly change the syntax</strong>.[7] Nonetheless, successive versions have added support for strings (Fortran 77), structured programming, array programming, modular programming, generic programming (Fortran 90), parallel computing (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming (Fortran 2003), and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).</p>
