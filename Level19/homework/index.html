    <strong>Fortran is a third generation, compiled, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.</strong>

<i>Fortran was originally developed by IBM.[3] It first compiled correctly in 1958.</i>[4]<b> Fortran computer programs have been written to support scientific and engineering applications</b>, <br>  <em>such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics,,br> geophysics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry.</em> <br> <i>It is a popular language for high-performance computing[5]</i> and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.[6][7]
<i>The IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer installation in 2007 at the Argonne Leadership Angela Yang Computing Facility located in the Argonne National Laboratory, in Lemont, Illinois,</i> <strong>US
Fortran has evolved through numerous versions and dialects.</strong> <em>In 1966, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed a standard for Fortran to limit proliferation of compilers using slightly different syntax.</em>[8] <br> <strong>Successive versions have added support for a character data type (Fortran 77), <b>structured programming, array programming, modular programming, generic programming (Fortran 90), parallel computing (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming (Fortran 2003)</em>, and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).</strong>

Since April 2024, Fortran has ranked among the top ten languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.[9]</em>
