    <p>I really like programming. <strong>I have been interested in this field for a long time and always wanted to pursue it</strong>, but at first I could not find a place that had the best environment with the best mentors. I learned that there is GOA,<i> the best place to learn programming and it is a very strong environment</i>.<b> I started programming because I want to become a very cool programmer</b>, <em>and then share my knowledge with others who will definitely do it</em>.<strong>I will put all my hard work into programming to become a very cool programmer</strong>.<i> GOA's best mentors are helping me learn this.</i>
